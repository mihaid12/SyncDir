Description: 
    Creates the server socket and executes listening on all server interfaces and port SrvPort. The routine saves the socket
    at the address pointed by the SrvSock argument.
Arguments:
    - SrvSock: Pointer to where the server socket ID will be stored before routine completion. Storage space must be provided by the caller.
    - SrvPort: Port for the server to wait on for incomming requests.
Return value: 
    STATUS_SUCCESS upon success, STATUS_FAIL otherwise.

Description: 
    The routine receives an operation packet (PACKET_OP) from a SyncDir client and outputs the operation in the OpReceived
    parameter.
Arguments:
    - RelativePath: Pointer to where the relative path of the file will be stored. The caller must provide the storage space.
    - OpReceived: Pointer to where the operation packet will be stored. The caller must provide the storage space.
    - SockConnID: Descriptor representing the socket connection with the SyncDir client application.
Return value: 
    STATUS_SUCCESS on success, STATUS_FAIL otherwise. STATUS_WARNING may be returned if the main purpose of the routine
    was achieved, but related issues were encountered (information is logged, thereby).

Description: 
    The routine completes the reception of a whole file sent by a SyncDir client application. The file content is stored at 
    the location pointed by FileFullPath and the size of the file is output at the FileSize address.
Arguments:
    - FileFullPath: Pointer to the full path where the routine stores the received file.
    - FileSize: Pointer to where the routine outputs the size of the received file. The caller must provide the storage space. 
    - SockConnID: Descriptor representing the socket connection with the SyncDir client application.
Return value:

Description: 
    The routine receives, stores and executes the operation sent by a SyncDir client application, inside the MainDirFullPath 
    directory. Information related to file modifications (such as hash codes, file sizes) are stored in the HashInfoHMap structure.
Arguments:
    - MainDirFullPath: Pointer to the full path of the server main directory, where the file operations are executed (the server 
    application sees this directory as its own "root" path).
    - HashInfoHMap: Reference to the structure containing the file hash information, including file paths, hash codes and file sizes.
    - SockConnID: Descriptor representing the socket connection with the SyncDir client application.
Return value: 
    STATUS_SUCCESS on success, STATUS_FAIL otherwise. STATUS_WARNING may be returned if the main purpose of the routine
